# KAmp

Audio amplifier based on the evaluation module from Texas Instruments.

It should be able to drive 2 speakers at a max of 50W each or a single speaker at a max of 100W (PBTL). Minimal changes are need to change to PBTL.

Multiple devices can be chained together using the Sync connectors. One device should be made Master while the others should operate as Slave devices.

This is not finished and not tested. Will keep updating if I feel like it.
